## ZenDesk for the Control Panel ##
An ExpressionEngine Extension that allows the loading of ZenDesk dropbox for use in the ExpressionEngine Control Panel
All customisation options are configuable from the extension settings page

Available in both EE1 and EE2 versions.
Note: EE2 version requires use of lower level CodeIgniter hooks due to EllisLab removing ControlPanel hooks. This is a bit of a hack.


## Installation ##

Choose EE1 or EE2 (depending on your installation).
Use the structure provided to place the files within your current EE installation.
Enable the extension in your EE control panel
