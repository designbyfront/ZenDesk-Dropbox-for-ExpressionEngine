## ZenDesk for the Control Panel ##
An ExpressionEngine Extension that allows the loading of ZenDesk dropbox for use in the ExpressionEngine Control Panel.<br />
All customisation options are configuable from the extension settings page

Available in both EE1 and EE2 versions.<br />
**Note:** EE2 version requires use of lower level CodeIgniter hooks due to EllisLab removing ControlPanel hooks. This is a bit of a hack.


## Installation ##

Choose EE1 or EE2 (depending on your installation).<br />
Use the structure provided to place the files within your current EE installation.<br />
Enable the extension in your EE control panel
